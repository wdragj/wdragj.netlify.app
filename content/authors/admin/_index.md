Hello! My name is Freddy Seo and I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, intending a focus on Artificial Intelligence.

I am an energetic and passionate college student aiming to use the knowledge and skills that I have acquired from coursework, bootcamp, side projects, and self study to become an experienced software developer/engineer.

Other than that, I really like coffee...
