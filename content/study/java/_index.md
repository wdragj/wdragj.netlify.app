## About java
---
- **Java is a simple programming language**:
  - Java is based on C++
  - Java has removed many confusing and rarely-used features e.g. explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc
  - Java takes care of memory management and
  - Java provides an automatic garbage collector. This collects the unused objects automatically.
- **Java is a platform-independent language:**
  - The programs written in Java language, after compilation, are converted into an intermediate level language called the bytecode
  - Bytecode is a part of the Java platform irrespective of the machine on which the programs run
  - This makes java highly portable as its bytecodes can be run on any machine by an interpreter called the Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
  - Therefore, java provides ‘reusability of code’.
- **Java is an object-oriented programming language:**
  - OOP makes the complete program simpler by dividing it into a number of objects
  - The objects can be used as a bridge to have data flow from one function to another
  - We can easily modify data and function’s as per the requirements of the program
- **Java is a robust language:**
  - Java programs must be reliable because they are used in both consumer and mission-critical applications, ranging from Blu-ray players to navigation systems
- **Java is a multithreaded language:**
  - Java can perform many tasks at once by defining multiple threads
  - For example, a program that manages a Graphical User Interface (GUI) while waiting for input from a network connection uses another thread to perform and wait’s instead of using the default GUI thread for both tasks
  - This keeps the GUI responsive
- **Java programs can create applets:**
  - Applets are programs that run in web browsers
  - But applets support was deprecated in Java 9 release and has been removed in Java 11 release due to waning browser support for the Java plugin
- **Java does not require any preprocessor:**
  - Java does not require inclusion of header files for creating a Java application

## Java Terminology
---
Below are some common terms of Java.  
1. **Java Virtual Machine(JVM):**
   * This is generally referred to as JVM
   * There are **three** execution phases of a program
   * They are **written**, **compile** and **run** the program
   * **Writing** a program is done by a java programmer
   * The **compilation** is done by the **JAVAC** compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output
   * In the **running** phase of a program, **JVM** executes the bytecode generated by the compiler

<br/>

The function of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler.
Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems.
This is why Java is known as a **platform-independent language**.

<br/>

2. **Bytecode in the Development process:**
   * The **Javac** compiler of JDK **compiles** the **java source code** into **bytecode** so that it can be executed by **JVM**
   * It is saved as **.class** file by the compiler
   * To view the bytecode, a disassembler like **Javap** can be used
3. **Java Development Kit(JDK):**
   * While we were using the term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.
